To Calculate the Average Wage by Industry, I used AverageIFS Function.

## AverageIFS Function
Description: Returns the average (arithmetic mean) of all cells that meet multiple criteria.

***What is the difference between Averageif and Averageifs?***
 Well, In terms of functionality, the most essential difference is that AVERAGEIF can only handle one condition while AVERAGEIFS one or more criteria.
